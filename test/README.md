# Using gitBook for IAMU documentation

## IAMU could use GitBook to:

* Create documentation on UNDL API
* Create applications profiles
* Create metadata guidelines and manuals.

### Why:

* It can be hosted online without the need for IT colleagues to intervene&#x20;
* GitBook does not require to know Markdown, but anyway it is easy to learn
  * [What is Markdown?](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
  * [Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
* Can be exported to:
  * PDF directly from the user interface - Requires pro plan
  * HTML or Word documents using other tools
* Can import content from HTML
  * I tried importing website from the UNBIS manual - Did not work (too heavy)
  * I tried to save the HTML page for the Leader and import it.
* Import from a Word document
* Can collaborate:
  * comments at the paragraph level
  * manage changes: in review, draft, merge archive.
    * we need to learn this part.
  * change history

### Why not

* Another thing to learn
* More features require subscriptions.&#x20;
  * PDF export
* Was not able to export the content in Marcdown&#x20;
  * Would probably require to synchronize with gitHUb and having the document as a repository.
